# Artifacts of Industry: Using Twine and Sound Methodologies to Revitalize Industrial Collections 
 
## About
This Twine was created for the Canada Science and Technology Museum's industrial artifacts collection, housed in their new storage facility in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It features creative soundscapes, written histories, oral interviews, and archival photographs for seven artifacts in the collection. The goal was two-fold: (1) to offer more digital signage and interpretation information about artifacts in the industrial collection, and (2) to bring more vitality to the artifacts through sound - personal interviews, interviews with experts, creative interpretations of what it sounded like to use the artifacts, etc.
